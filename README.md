# MirrorWall

Design tokens, layout, component macros, SSE and JSON/error envelope helpers so three applications look like one family without sharing a page.

**Status:** specified, not yet implemented. This repository currently holds the project scaffold
(directory structure, tooling configuration, and a local copy of the relevant suite documentation) —
see [development plan](docs/packages/mirrorwall/development-plan.md) for what each phase adds.

Part of the **Local AI Suite** — see [docs/architecture/executive-summary.md](docs/architecture/executive-summary.md)
for how MirrorWall fits with the suite's other applications and packages.

## Install

```bash
pip install mirrorwall
```

## Quickstart

```python
import mirrorwall
```

See [docs/packages/mirrorwall/spec.md](docs/packages/mirrorwall/spec.md) §20 for a runnable example.

## Documentation

This repository carries its own copy of the relevant suite documentation under [`docs/`](docs/README.md),
so it can be read and implemented independently of the other eight suite repositories. Start with
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).
